# Set 1

# PROBLEM 11

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    Can list be empty?
#    Will the list contain negative numbers?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Loop through list
#    Print index

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    for i in range(len(lst)): print(index)

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# PROBLEM 12

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    Does the value being negative or postiive matter?
#    Are we guranteed all values in the list are unique?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Loop through list to  ind the index of a target value

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Loop through list:
#       if the lst[i] == target:
#           return i
#    otherwise return -1

# Set 2

# PROBLEM 11

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    Does the nums being postiive or negative matter?
#    What are  the two possible ways that you can work on the new stuff

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Loop through the list and find the value at each odd index

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Loop through the list:
#       ind odd res by using this line of code: i % 2 == 1
#       print the values at odd res

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# PROBLEM 12

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    Will we be guranteed positive numbers?
#    Is there a limit to repeat numbers?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Loop through the list, and if element  at correct index, add index to res

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    res = []
#    Loop through list: append when index matches target
#    return res
