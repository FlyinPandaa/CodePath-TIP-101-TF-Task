# PROBLEM 1

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    Will we need to account for different inputs?
#    How do we set the root of a binary tree?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Declare root and add the nodes using the TreeNode class.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    root = TreeNode(10)
#    root.left
#    root.right

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(1)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# PROBLEM 2

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    What if the inputs are empty?
#    Are there any time/space constraints?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Add the two children nodes and check if the sum adds up to the root.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Check if the the root will be empty
#    Return the sum of the left and right value and check if that sum is equal to the root.

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(1)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# PROBLEM 3

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    Would we have cases where the tree is empty?
#    What hapens if all or some of the inputs are negative?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Check if the root is empty, if so return False. If not then add sum of children and compare the sum to the target.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Check if root is empty: return false
#    Set the left and right value to 0
#    Grab the values from the left and right node
#    Add the two nodes and compare to the root

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(1)

# PROBLEM 4

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    Do we return False or None for the output if the tree is empty?
#    What if the tree is an invalid binary tree?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Check if the root or leftmost child is present, if so, recurssively follow the leftmost child until we reach the end of the list.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Check if root or leftmost child is empty: return None or return value of root
#    Recursively call the left_most(root) 

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# PROBLEM 5

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    Would we use a for loop or a while loop for an iterative solution?
#    Will we have to account for an invalid tree?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Find the leftmost child using an iterative approach.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Check if root is None: return None
#    Using a while loop, set the condition to continue the loop only if there is a left node to traverse to
#    return the left most child's value

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(n)
