# PROBLEM 1

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    What if the 'nums' array is empty?
#    Will all integers be positive?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Use hashing to keep track of integers we have seen. Set to return True when finding an integer. If  end of loop and no same integers were encountered, return false.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Create empty hash set
#    Loop through the integers in the array:
#      If integer is seen in the set: return True
#      Else add the integer to the set
#    return false if loop doesn't find duplicates

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(n) - Has to iterate through each integer in the array
# Space Complexity: O(n) - need additional space for set.

# PROBLEM 2

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    What if the list of integers is empty?
#    What does "in-place" mean?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Utilize a pointer to keep track of current position. Replace elements that are not equal to the target value. Increment pointer.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Initialize pointer
#    Loop through each element in the array
#      if the current element is  not equal to val
#        replace the current with the nums(i)
#        increment pointer
#    return the pointer

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(n) - Need to traverse the array
# Space Complexity: O(1) - Only need constant space

# PROBLEM 3

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    What if one or both strings are empty?
#    What if there is no GCD for a test case?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Use GCD of the lengths of the strings and find the largest divisor string. Check if the string divides string 1 and string 2.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Create a helper that checks if string can be divisible
#    Find the GCD of string 1  and 2
#    Use the GCD length to get a possible divisor
#    Check if the substring can divide both string 1 and 2
#    If can divide both string: return the substring
#    If not return empty string

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(n) - Need to traverse both strings
# Space Complexity: O(1) - No additional space needed

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    What if the tree is empty?
#    What if one tree only goes down one side of the tree?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Utilize recursion to check if the tree is balanced or not by checking if the left or right subtree's height difference is not more than 1.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Define a helper function that checks the balance and height of the tree
#    Call helper function to check if tree is balanced
#    Return if the tree is balanced or not
