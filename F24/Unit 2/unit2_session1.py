# PROBLEM 7

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    What if the rating is empty?
#    How do we grab the look at only the rating in the list of inputs?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Loop through the list, and find the ratings of all the items in the list. Find the highest rating and set that to result.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    if not books: return None
#    set res = books[0]
#    Loop through list:
#       compare current element to the current highest rated book
#         replace the highest rating book if needed
#    return the res

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    What if the list is empty?
#    Do we need to use a hashmap?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Turn a list of values into a map.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    iv_map = {}
#    loop through the list:
#       turn the list of values into a map
#    return iv_map

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# PROBLEM 7

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    What if the 'ratings' is blank/empty?
#    Can the entire movies list be empty?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Create two dictionaries. One for mapping genre to rating, and another mapping genre to number of movies.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Create two count/rating dictionaires
#    loop through the movie list:
#       Add the movie rating to rating total
#       Increment the movie total by 1
#    Else, add the rating as a new genre
#    set avg_rating to 0
#    Loop through each of the genres:
#       Calculate the avgerage rating for each genre
#       compare current highest rating to the current value
#    Return highest rating by genre

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    How do we create a new dictionary to return the correct key-value pair.
#    What if 'threshold' is empty?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Loop through the list of products and compare their scores to the threshold. Assign pass or fail and add the elements to a new dictionary.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Create product dictionary
#    Loop through the list of products:
#       If below threshold: "fail"
#       If above threshold: "pass"
#    Return the product dictionary
