# PROBLEM 1

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    What if the input is empty?
#    How much time does it take

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Recursively validate if the parantheses are nested.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    If string is empty, return true
#    if length of s >= 2 and s[0] == either '(' or ')':
#      return function(s[1:-1])
#    return False

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Use binary search to find where the 1s begin, and count from there.
