# PROBLEM 1

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    Will there be any new variables that will be needed in the problem?
#    Will the self.is_caught always equal false?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Call the constructor and store the specified name and type.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    declare my pokemon variable
#    call constructor and input the desired name and type

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(1)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# PROBLEM 2

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    How do we call the print_pokemon function?
#    Will we be able to keep adding new objects under the class?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Create a new object called squirtle in the Pokemon2 class. Print using the print method provided.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Squirtle = Pokemon2(...)
#    Call print function from Pokemon2 class.

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(1)

# PROBLEM 3

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    Do we need to change anythin in the print function?
#    Is there a way to update the attribute in the init function without manually adjusting the is_caught.

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Set the self.is_caught to true.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    self.is_caught = True

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(1)

# PROBLEM 4

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    Will we need to modify other objects?
#    Do we need to set the is_caught attribute back to false?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Create a new method to set the is_caught attribute to True when called.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Define catch method.
#    Set self.is_caught = True

# PROBLEM 5

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#    Will we always assume the choose method will call a already caught pokemon?
#    Do we need to account for if we fail to catch the pokemon?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#    Add new method catch. Check if the pokemon is caught, if so print out the choose statement. If not set catch to true.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    if caught:
#      [pokemon], I choose you!
#    else:
#      A wild [pokemon] appeared! Try catching it!
