# PROBLEM [Version 1]

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#       What if n is negative?
#       What if non-prime number returns less than 2?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#       First check if n is less than 2.
#       Check factors of 2 up until square root of n.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    if n <= 1:
#      return false
#    set i = 2
#    while i * i <= n:
#      if n % i == 0:
#        return False
#       otherwise increment i by 1
#    return true

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# PROBLEM 2 [Version 1]

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#       What if the list is empty?
#       What does "in-place" mean?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#       Utilize the two pointer method to start from the end of the list and beginning of the list to reverse list.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Initialize the two pointers left and right
#    while left < right:
#      swap elements
#      increment left pointer
#      decrement right pointer
#    return the list

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# PROBLEM 3 [Version 1]

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#       What is time and space complexity?
#       Which method is faster? Two pointer or slicing?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#       Analyze the two different codes to come up with the time and space complexity of both methods of reversing a list.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Two pointer: 
#      time:
#      space:
#    Slicing:
#      time:
#      space:

# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:
#    Two pointer: 
#      time: O(n) - Same time complexity.
#      space: O(1)- More efficient use of space.
#    Slicing:
#      time: O(n) - Same time complexity.
#      space: O(n) - Requires additional space to reverse list.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# PROBLEM 4 [Version 1]

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#       What happens if all numbers are even?
#       Will the input list ever be empty?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#       Use two-pointer method to separate even and odd numbers into two lists.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Initialize two pointers 'left' and 'right'
#    while left < right:
#      if even: increment left pointer
#      else if odd: decrement right pointer
#      else: swap left pointer to odd number and right pointer to even number

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# PROBLEM 5 [Version 1]

# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
#       What if the list of strings  is empty?
#       Will the solution have to take into account integers being mixed in with the string?

# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:
#       Utilize a helper function to look at each string in the list and return the string that is a palindrome. If none, return an empty string.

# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
#    Helper function:
#      initialize left and right pointer
#      While left < right:
#        if left pointer not equal to right pointer:
#          return False
